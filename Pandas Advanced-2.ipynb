    "### Q1. Write a code to print the data present in the second row of the dataframe, df.\n",

    "### Q2. What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2.\n",
    "\n",
    "loc: It is used to access a group of rows and columns by labels or a boolean array. It is primarily label based.\n",
    "iloc: It is used for integer-location based indexing, where we specify rows and columns by their integer index.\n",
    "### Q3. Reindex the given dataframe using a variable, reindex = [3,0,1,2] and store it in the variable, new_df then find the output for both new_df.loc[2] and new_df.iloc[2].\n",

    "### Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "A6.\n",
    "In pandas, window functions are used for computing aggregates over a sliding or rolling window of data. Some common types of window functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling: Computes aggregate functions over a fixed-size window of data.\n",
    "Expanding: Computes aggregate functions over all data points up to the current point.\n",
    "Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Computes a weighted moving average where more recent data points are given higher weights.\n",
